# tinyapp

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Purpose

Tinyapp folder contains was an introductory project to embedded javascript and building a server in express.

This is a simple multipage app:

- with authentication protection
- that reacts appropriately to the user's logged-in state,
- and permits the user to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) a simple entity (e.g. blog posts, URL shortener).

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**
This project was created and published by Ashton Ferguson as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.
